simple image seaming program

program description:
-takes in image and smaller dimensions and outputs a seamed image

usage:
-'make' to compile
-requires slvector to be in ../common
-executable name is seam
-'seam <input file> <output file> <new width> <new height>'
-note that it does pretty much no error checking on files
-only makes images smaller (new dimensions have to be smaller)

implementation notes:
-although i think i definitely used the energy function given in class,
my results look different from the ones on the website...didn't really know
what to do about that
