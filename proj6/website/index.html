          <h1>Good Case</h1>
          <p>The algorithm is effective on this picture of a wide valley in Vietnam, reducing the width of the valley and turning the valley road into a thin dirt path.</p>

          <h1>Maybe Case</h1>
          <p>The algorithm kind of works well on this image of the Geisel Library, which has some straight lines that the algorithm ends up bending a bit.  Depending on what the user wants, this may be desired, as the result produces what might be considered interesting architecture in the glass. Also, the building in the background which seems to have recieved priority by the algorithm is preserved.</p>

          <h1>Bad Case</h1>
          <p>The algorithm has trouble producing acceptable results when given inputs that contain a lot of details that must be preserved to be considered acceptable by human eyes.  We expect there to be straight lines in this image of a library, and when these lines are no longer straight it causes the whole image to look off.  The algorithm also mercilessly reduces humans, which immediately look off to our human eyes as we are used to seeing humans in their full shape, but of course the algorithm would not know to prioritise humans. The whole image looks off because of what we are used to, but we can see the algorithm is actually doing its job if we look at small details that are preserved, such as the second light, the windows, and the foremost chair, which has been reduced in an interesting way.</p>
